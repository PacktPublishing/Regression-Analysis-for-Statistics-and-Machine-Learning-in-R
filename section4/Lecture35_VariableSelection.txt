#determine the amount of Y variance explained by each of the 
#12 predictors in the data.

### variable importance using caret package 
### can be used with any regression model
library(caret)

varImp(fit1, scale = FALSE)

#For regression, the relationship between each predictor 
#and the outcome is evaluated. 
#An argument, nonpara, is used to pick the model fitting technique.
#When nonpara = FALSE, a linear model is fit and the absolute value of
#the t-value for the slope of the predictor is used. 
#Otherwise, a loess smoother is fit between the outcome and the 
#predictor. The R2 statistic is calculated for this model 
#against the intercept only null model. 
#This number is returned as a relative measure of variable importance.
