############ Confidence interval################

#The confidence level describes the uncertainty associated with a sampling method. 
# A 95% confidence level means that 95% of the intervals would include the parameter; and so on.

#provide a measure of precision for linear regression coefficient 
#estimates.

#The gray ‘bands’ around the regression line in the plot 
#represent the range in which the true regression line lies 
#at a certain level of confidence (95% in the plot). 
#The bands visualize all intervals for every possible x and are 
#tightest where the data is grouped more densely.

new.dat = data.frame(age=1500)
predict(fit, newdata = new.dat, interval = 'confidence')

# the fitted c at a 1500 age is just above 177 cm. 
#The confidence interval of (164.85, 190.25) signifies the range in 
#which the true population parameter lies at a 95% level of confidence.

# Confidence Interval of the Slope Estimate

confint(fit)

#The fitted reg coeff of slope is 0.106 
#with an interval of (0.09, 0.12)
# if it does not contain 0 the regression coefficent is statistically significant
